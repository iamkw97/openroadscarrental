                            Our goal is to offer transparency throughout the booking process and during your rental period.
                            Usually, the insurance terms are hard to understand, but we want to change that. Here we try to
                            explain the insurances, so they are easy to understand. This way you know what is included and
                            what is not, so nothing should come as a surprise to you.

                            When you book a car through our website there are four insurances that are included in the price
                            Each insurance has a liability (excess). That means if you happen to have damage to the car when
                            you return it you will be charged the liability (excess) amount.

                            CDW and SCDW cover the bodywork of the car. In a collision, the bodywork is usually the first
                            thing that gets damaged. The liability (excess) depends on the size of the car.
                        </p>

                            Example: You return a 2WD car with a dent on the passenger door. We inspect the car and see that
                            the damage was not there when you picked up the car. Our employee will let you know about the
                            new damage and charge you 90.000 ISK (approx. $700). The 90.000 ISK (approx. $700) is the
                            absolute maximum you will be charged. If the third-party damage repair report will estimate that
                            the repair will cost less than 90.000 ISK ($700) the difference will be refunded.

                        <h3>GRAVEL PROTECTION (GP) (INCLUDED)</h3>
                        <p class="text_justify">
                            The gravel protection is important insurance while renting a car in Iceland. Gravel are common
                            around the whole Iceland. When driving on gravel roads the small stones will leave chipped paint
                            at the front of the bumper. Chipped paint damages are nothing to worry about and you will not be
                            charged for them.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text_justify">
                            The gravel protection also covers the windscreen, headlights, and mirrors.
                            {{-- The liability
                            (excess) for broken windscreen, headlights, and mirrors is 20.000 ISK (approx. $150). --}}
                        </p>

                        <h3>THEFT PROTECTION (TP) (INCLUDED)</h3>
                        <p class="text_justify">
                            Luckily Iceland is a very safe place and vehicle thefts are not very common. Though this is not
                            common the car is always covered by insurance if it gets stolen. Theft protection has no
                            liability (excess).
                            Keep in mind that TP does not cover items stolen within the vehicle.
                        </p>

                        <h3>SAND & ASH PROTECTION (SAAP) (INCLUDED)</h3>
                        <p class="text_justify">
                            The SAAP insurance was introduced because our standard insurance did not cover sand and ash
                            damages. Sand damage is very common damage, especially when driving on the south coast. This can
                            happen all year round.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text_justify">
                            Sand and ash damages are extremely costly and without the SAAP the cost for the damage
                            is completely the renterâ€™s responsibility.
                            {{-- The SAAP reduces the liability down to 90.000 ISK (approx. $900)
                            The price per day is 1.650 ISK --}}
